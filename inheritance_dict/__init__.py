        Return the value associated with a key, resolving class inheritance for type keys.

        If `key` is a class (a `type`), this looks up values for each class in the key's
        method resolution order (MRO) and returns the first found mapping value.
        If `key` is not a class, it is used directly as the lookup key.

        Parameters:
            key: The lookup key. If a `type`, the MRO (key.__mro__) is searched in order;
            otherwise `key` itself is used.

        Returns:
            The mapped value for the first matching key.

        Raises:
            KeyError: If no matching key is found.
